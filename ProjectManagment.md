## General guidance of version control
1) **Master Branch** - Each repository has a master branch, which is the default branch to work with. It should be stable and each contributor should make sure any pulls do not have any conflict.
2) **Experimenting Branch** - To implement a new feature that may or maynot work in the end, an **Experimenting Branch** would be good in order to have several collaborators to work together. This is generally for tasks that are not very sure to be acceted, and it is difficult to reverse back. Note for bug fixes which do not introduce new features should be done with the **Master Branch**. 
3) **Collaborator** - Each collaborator may clone or fork from a selected branch for your own need. When the changes are done, file a *Pull Request* to the branch of your selection, fix conflicts and accept the request.
4) **Release** - When a release is made, a new branch such as "Release_000" is made in the reporsitory. This branch is for archival purpose, which does not accept any changes. Any bug fixes should be made to the **Master Branches**, which may be used for next (bug-fix) release.
5) **Project Board** - is good for project managment. There is global one for entire hub, also there is a local one for each repository . The cards can be edited and moved to different catagories.
