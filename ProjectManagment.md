## General guidance of version control
1) **Master Branch** - Each repository has a master branch, which is the **Default** branch to work with. The **Mater Branch** should be as stable as possible, and each contributor should make sure any pulls do not cause conflicts or introduce new bugs.
2) **Experimenting Branch** - To implement a new feature that may or maynot work in the end, an **Experimenting Branch** would be good in order to have several collaborators to work together. This is generally for tasks that are not certain to be acceted, and it may be too difficult to reverse back. Pull from **Experimental Branch** to **Master Branch** should be done when the new features are accepted. 
3) **Collaborator** - Each collaborator may clone or fork from a **selected branch** for your own need. When the changes are done, file a *Pull Request* to the **selected branch**, fix conflicts and accept the request.
4) **Release** - is made from the **Master Branch**. When a release is made, a new branch such as "Release_000" is made in the reporsitory, which is for archival purpose. The released branch does not accept any changes normally. Any bug-fixes which do not introduce uncertain features should be made to the **Master Branch**, which will be released later.
5) **Project** - is a collection of cards for information and discussion. There is global one for entire account, and there is one for each repository. Check the **Project** board for project related informaiton, the cards can be added, edited, moved and deleted.
